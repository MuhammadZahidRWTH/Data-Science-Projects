Credit Risk Prediction using Random Forest
This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model for classifying credit risk using the Random Forest algorithm. The analysis is conducted in R, and it includes various data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and results documentation.

Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to predict the credit risk of individuals based on multiple features. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables. The Random Forest model is trained using 10-fold cross-validation, and the performance is evaluated using the AUC score from the ROC curve.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in credit_data.csv. It contains information about individuals' credit risk, along with various features like age, occupation, and other financial attributes.

Dataset Structure
Numeric Variables: Age, income, credit score, etc.
Categorical Variables: Occupation, credit risk, etc.
Target Variable: credit_risk (binary classification: "good" or "bad")
Steps Involved
1. Install and Load Necessary Packages
Required R packages:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "DataExplorer", "corrplot", "randomForest", "DMwR", "pROC"))
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(DataExplorer)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(DMwR)
library(pROC)
2. Load and Explore the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using read.csv().
The dataset structure is explored using glimpse() and summary().
Missing values are visualized using the plot_missing() function from the DataExplorer package.
Distribution of numeric variables is visualized with histograms.
3. Handle Missing Values
Missing values in the occupation column are handled by replacing non-standard missing values (e.g., "NA", "unknown") with NA and imputing them with the most frequent value.
Missing values in the age column are replaced with the median age.
Other categorical variables are also imputed using the most frequent value.
4. Encode Categorical Variables
Categorical variables are encoded into numeric format using the model.matrix() function.

5. Feature Scaling
Numeric features are scaled using the scale() function to standardize the values.

6. Split the Dataset
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using createDataPartition().

7. Handle Class Imbalance
The class imbalance in the target variable (credit_risk) is addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This technique generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the distribution of the target variable.

8. Train the Random Forest Model
The Random Forest model is trained using 10-fold cross-validation (trainControl()) and evaluated using 5-fold tuning (tuneLength = 5). The model is trained to predict credit_risk.

9. Evaluate Model Performance
Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.
A confusion matrix is generated to assess classification performance.
Feature importance is visualized to understand which features contribute the most to the prediction.
The ROC curve is plotted to visualize model performance, and the AUC (Area Under the Curve) score is computed.
10. Save Results
Predictions are saved to a CSV file: credit_risk_predictions_rf.csv.
Documentation detailing the steps, model performance, and execution time is saved to a text file: model_workflow_documentation.txt.
A summary of execution time and AUC score is saved in model_execution_summary.txt.
Results
AUC Score: The AUC score is calculated using the ROC curve to measure the predictive performance of the model. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance.
Feature Importance: The most influential features in predicting credit risk are identified.
Execution Time: The total time taken for execution is also logged.
Documentation
The following documentation is generated during execution:

Missing values in 'age' replaced with median.
Non-standard missing values in 'occupation' replaced with NA and imputed with mode.
Class imbalance addressed using SMOTE to oversample the minority class and undersample the majority.
Random Forest model trained using 10-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Achieved AUC score of AUC_value on the test set, indicating good predictive performance.
Execution completed at execution_time.
Running the Analysis
To run this analysis:

Install the necessary R packages (as listed above).
Ensure that the credit_data.csv file is in the working directory or update the file path in the script.
Execute the provided R script in RStudio or any R environment.
Files Generated
credit_risk_predictions_rf.csv: A CSV file containing the predicted credit risk labels for the test set.
model_workflow_documentation.txt: A text file containing a detailed step-by-step workflow of the analysis.
model_execution_summary.txt: A text file containing the execution time and AUC score.
Execution Time
The total execution time is recorded in model_execution_summary.txt and is provided in minutes.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a credit risk prediction model using Random Forest, including handling missing data, addressing class imbalance, and evaluating model performance using the AUC score. The generated predictions can be used to assess individuals' credit risk for further decision-making.
